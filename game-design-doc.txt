Project Codename: Ashfall
1. High Concept

Ashfall is a multiplayer survival **action RPG** where you play a **hero character**: you level up, gear up, and take on escalating enemies and bosses with **WoW-inspired combat** (quick movement, hotbar abilities, cooldown windows, readable telegraphs, satisfying AoE). Exploration is fast and fluid thanks to **mounted traversal** and quick dismount-to-fight pacing.

Optional competitive incentives (events/objectives/ladders) can refresh on a cadence, but the core game should not feel like an RTS “war sim” or colony economy loop.

The game blends:

Survival crafting (Valheim / Rust)

Hero action combat (WoW)

Optional seasonal structure

Every journey is a co-op survival story.
Every season is an opportunity to expand the world with new biomes, bosses, and goals.

2. Core Fantasy

Become a hero. Master your build. Explore the world. Defeat bosses. Earn your legacy.

Players are:

physically embodied heroes

survivors and explorers in a dangerous world

3. Core Pillars
3.1 Embodied Survival

WASD, third-person, action combat. The player is physically vulnerable.

3.2 WoW-Inspired Combat + Movement

Quick, responsive traversal and hotbar ability combat (cooldowns, AoE, defensives, interrupts, curated CC).

3.3 Hero Identity / Buildcraft

Players ascend into heroes with abilities and skill trees.

3.4 Mounted Exploration

The world is meant to be traveled; mounts make exploration fast and satisfying.

3.5 Homestead Building (Core Survival Support)

Valheim-like base building supports the adventure loop (crafting/comfort/storage/travel) and long-term survival.

3.6 Seasonal Structure (Optional Competitive Layer)

Optional events/objectives/ladders can exist as an overlay, but the core game is a persistent survival RPG, not a weekly war sim.

3.7 Escalating Threats

The world becomes more hostile every day.

4. Game Structure
World Shards

Small, persistent worlds (e.g., 1–8 players recommended; larger shared shards possible) that host long-term survival and progression.

Solo or 2–6 player groups (friends, small factions) can share homesteads and coordinate exploration.

The world runs continuously; bases remain active while players are offline and are intended to be **homes**, not disposable match artifacts.

Optional event calendars (weekly, monthly, seasonal) can layer on top of this persistent world, but there is **no mandatory world collapse/reset** in the core design.

5. Example Weekly Event Arc
Day 1–2: Establishment

Land rush

Starter bases

Low PvP

Day 3–4: Expansion

NPC camp conflict

Faction tension rises

Strategic resource fights

Day 5–6: Collapse Phase

Base sieges

elite monsters

territory wars

Day 7: Final Stand

Apocalypse event

forced convergence

last battles determine ranking

The world does **not** reset after this arc; instead, the calendar can repeat, evolve, or advance the overall narrative. These events are a pacing layer for a persistent survival world, not hard match boundaries.

6. Seasonal Structure

A season contains:

- new or highlighted biomes, bosses, and events
- cosmetic + prestige rewards
- optional leaderboard visibility

Seasonal goals:

- encourage long-term play and exploration
- reward mastery of PvE content (biome completion, boss progression, homestead development)
- create a sense of evolving world narrative

At season end:

- rewards are distributed
- any optional ladders/leaderboards can roll over or reset
- new seasonal goals and content are introduced

7. Seasonal Ranking System (Optional)

If a ladder is used, players primarily earn points from:

- NPC camp clears
- boss kills and world event participation
- exploration milestones (biomes mastered, POIs discovered)
- homestead development milestones
- optional PvP victories (if enabled), without being the dominant score source

Rank tiers example:

Bronze

Iron

Silver

Gold

Mythic

Legend

Ranks represent overall mastery of Ashfall’s survival and PvE systems, not just kill count.

8. Player Lifecycle
Phase 1: Adventurer

basic kit online immediately

clear early POIs

first gear upgrades

Phase 2: Specialization

talents/runes/augments unlock build identity

mobility + AoE + defensives come online

target elite objectives (bosses, contested events)

Phase 3: Endgame Mastery

optimized builds and gear chasing

high-skill combat vs elite threats

optional ladders/events/PvP hotspots tied to objectives

9. Hero System

Heroes gain:

XP from combat

camp clears

defense events

faction wars

Leveling grants:

ability upgrades

passives

traits

Archetype examples:

Warlord (army buffs)

Architect (base power)

Hunter (PvP assassin)

Warden (defense)

Mystic (control/support)

Hero progression resets weekly.
Account unlocks persist seasonally.

10. Death System

Hero death results in:

inventory drop

potential gear loss

respawn timer

temporary injury debuff

Hero identity persists.
Inventory risk remains.

Death is punishing, not deleting.

11. Movement & Combat
Controls

WASD movement

third-person camera

ability hotbar

dodge/mobility

Combat Goals

weighty

responsive

readable

skill expressive

Inspired by WoW + survival action combat.

12. Base Building System

Valheim/Rust-style construction:

snap placement

blueprint preview

crafting stations + storage

comfort/home buffs

optional travel convenience

Base tiers:

Tier 1 — Outpost
Tier 2 — Settlement
Tier 3 — Stronghold

13. AI Unit System
Optional helpers/automation (if included) must be bounded and must not become an RTS micro layer.

14. Resource Economy
Common

wood, stone, scrap, fiber

Strategic

relics, cores, rare metals

Strategic resources drive long-term progression and can create natural points of social convergence (and optional PvP) in higher-threat biomes.

15. NPC Camp System

PvE escalation gates:

bandit camps

fortified strongholds

bosses

world event zones

Primarily serve as PvE challenges and social gathering hotspots; on PvP-enabled servers they can also become contested zones.

16. Territory System

Soft influence model:

Optional PvP objectives model:

contested hotspots tied to elite objectives/events

avoid offline-base raiding as a primary loop

17. Progression Layers
Persistent Hero Progression

hero levels
gear
build unlocks

Seasonal Persistence

cosmetics
blueprints
traits
prestige ranks

18. Emotional Design Goals

The game should generate stories:

last stand defenses

risky loot runs

hero duels

betrayal alliances

collapse finales

Memory > loot.

19. MVP Scope

Prototype includes:

1 biome

20–30 player shard

Tier 1 base building (camp + crafting + comfort)

hero prototype (WoW-like movement feel + splashy ability kit)

mount traversal prototype

NPC camps tier 1–2

1 boss encounter

optional event cadence prototype

Goal: validate tension loop.

20. Key Risks

snowball factions

offline raiding frustration

system overload

complexity intimidation

server cost

burnout from cadence

Requires careful pacing + onboarding.
