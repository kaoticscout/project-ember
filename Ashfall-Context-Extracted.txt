Project: Ashfall

NOTE (direction update):
- This file is a raw extract from earlier brainstorming when Ashfall was framed as a “survival RTS with weekly resets.”
- The current direction is **hero-first survival action RPG** (Valheim x WoW): quick movement, splashy abilities, mounted exploration, WoW-like combat; **base building is secondary**.
- See `Ashfall-Game-Design-Document.md` and `Ashfall-Product-Requirements-Document.md` for the updated source-of-truth framing.

I want to create a game PRD that combines Valheim, RUST,
RTS games but is in the style of a multiplayer survival RTS. I
want it to be non-persistent and take place over the
course of a week.
Love this concept — a week-long, non-persistent survival RTS is a really fresh hybrid. Let’s
structure this like a real PRD draft you could hand to a team. I’ll write it in a professional
format but keep it high-level enough to iterate.
📄 Product Requirements Document
Project Codename: Ashfall
1. Vision Statement
Ashfall is a multiplayer survival RTS where small teams of players cooperate and compete
over the course of a 7-day world cycle. Players gather resources, build fortifications,
command units, and survive escalating environmental and PvP threats. At the end of the
cycle, the world collapses, scores are tallied, and a new world begins.
The game blends:
Valheim → exploration + survival crafting
RUST → PvP tension + territory control
RTS → base management + unit command
Seasonal roguelite loop → weekly reset with meta progression
The core fantasy:
2. Core Pillars

5. Game Systems

-- 3 of 50 --

5.1 Survival Systems
Hunger / stamina / temperature
Crafting tiers
Weather hazards
Biome-specific survival rules
Failure to maintain survival → penalties → vulnerability in PvP
5.2 RTS Colony System
Players can:
Recruit AI settlers
Assign jobs:
Gather
Build
Defend
Scout
Build automated production chains
This creates:
Key design constraint:
Offline advantage must not equal offline dominance.
5.3 Territory & Warfare
Soft territory system (influence zones)
Claim beacons
Fortifiable strongholds
Raid windows tied to escalation phases
No permanent safety → risk is constant.
A living base that runs while players are offline
but is vulnerable to attack

-- 4 of 50 --

5.4 World Escalation System
Every day introduces modifiers:
Examples:
Day 3: Blood Moon — monsters attack bases
Day 5: Resource decay — scarcity pressure
Day 6: Storm zone shrink (battle royale influence)
Day 7: Apocalypse — forced convergence
This ensures pacing and prevents stagnation.
6. Progression & Meta
Weekly Score Categories
Territory control
Military strength
Resource stockpile
PvE accomplishments
Survival efficiency
Faction dominance
Persistent Progression
Players earn:
Account perks
Cosmetic unlocks
Strategic starting bonuses
Commander traits

-- 5 of 50 --

7. Social Structure
Factions capped at small sizes
Temporary alliances allowed
Betrayal is possible and supported
In-game diplomacy tools
The social drama is part of the design.
8. Reset Philosophy
Reset is not punishment.
Reset is:
Relief
Excitement
Fresh strategy
Narrative closure
Each week is a self-contained war story.
Players return because:
9. Monetization (Optional Direction)
Cosmetic skins
Commander cosmetics
Seasonal passes
Non-power account progression

✅ Combat model
✅ RTS UI mock
✅ Monetization plan

-- 7 of 50 --

✅ Technical server model
✅ Pitch deck version
✅ Steam store description
✅ GDD expansion
✅ Player journey walkthrough
✅ Example 1-week narrative
Just tell me what direction you want to take it next.
Can you jot a note down for later, What about combining
this with a hero character like in Warcraft 3
Updated saved memory
Noted — that’s a strong direction. A Warcraft 3–style hero layer would add identity,
progression, and emotional attachment to the weekly loop. We can later explore:
Hero leveling within the 7-day cycle
Hero permadeath stakes
Unique hero abilities that shape faction strategy
Hero extraction / legacy rewards at world reset
Commander-as-hero vs separate hero unit
When you’re ready, we can design the hero system as its own pillar and plug it into the
PRD.
Okay, so some ideas. The main character starts as a unit
like an scv (or builder) in starcraft 2. Their goal is to collect
things like wood and rocks, there are also npc camps that
contain goods that can be used to build and upgrade
buildings in a base that the player can create. This base
can have defenses, and harvester type units. The

-- 8 of 50 --

harvesters allow for a static generation of resources. When
the player leaves the base, they are vulnerable to other
players. If they die while out and about, they drop their
things. Things can include weapons, armor, items, building
materials, and special components.
The challenge in this game is progressively fighting strong
and more powerful players and NPC camps.
This is a great concrete foundation — you’re basically describing a survival RTS with
embodied risk: the commander is physically present in the world and can be killed. That’s
powerful because it ties macro strategy to personal stakes.
Let me formalize your ideas into a structured system draft and expand them so you can
see how they scale.
🧠 Core Concept Expansion
Player Fantasy
You’re not a floating RTS camera.
You are a vulnerable builder in a hostile world.
This creates tension:
Leaving base = risk
Staying home = stagnation
Expansion = exposure
That’s the engine of the game.
🔁 Core Gameplay Loop (Refined)
1. Spawn as Builder Unit
“I am the founder of a fragile colony. My body is the weak point. My empire is my
weapon.”

-- 9 of 50 --

2. Gather raw resources manually
3. Establish starter base
4. Create automated harvesters
5. Equip yourself with gear
6. Venture outward for rare components
7. Fight NPC camps / rival players
8. Upgrade base + army
9. Repeat at higher stakes
The loop becomes:
🧱 Base System
Starter Phase
The player begins with:
Basic tool
Tiny stash
No protection
Manual gathering only
This phase should feel scrappy and dangerous.
Think: Valheim day 1 energy.
Base Progression Tiers
Tier 1: Outpost
Small crafting station
Resource storage
1–2 harvesters
Basic wall segments
Purpose: survival
Personal risk → empire growth → larger risk → larger empire

-- 10 of 50 --

Tier 2: Settlement
Automated production chains
Defensive towers
AI guards
Equipment crafting
Purpose: growth
Tier 3: Stronghold
Advanced defenses
Elite unit training
Rare crafting
Territory influence
Purpose: dominance
⛏ Resource Model
You want layered resource types:
Common Resources
Wood
Stone
Scrap
Fiber
Used for:
Walls
Tools
Basic structures
Low risk, local gathering.
Strategic Resources

-- 11 of 50 --

Found in NPC camps or contested zones:
Power cores
Rare metals
Ancient tech
Relics
Monster trophies
Used for:
High-tier buildings
Advanced units
Hero upgrades (future system)
Endgame gear
These drive conflict.
🧍 Player Body System
This is one of your strongest ideas.
The player is:
✔ A builder
✔ A combatant
✔ A loot carrier
✔ A risk vessel
Death Rules
When killed outside base:
Drop inventory
Drop equipped gear (partial or full)
Body can be looted
Respawn at base
This creates:
PvP tension
Escort gameplay
Raiding incentives

-- 12 of 50 --

Retrieval missions
Optional modifier:
🤖 AI Units
Harvester Units
Passive resource generation
Require upkeep
Vulnerable to raids
Repairable
This ensures:
Combat Units
Guards
Patrol squads
Escort units
Players command them RTS-style:
Rally points
Patrol routes
Defense zones
This bridges survival and RTS.
🗺 NPC Camp System
NPC camps are escalation gates.
Insurance system for critical items
(late-game unlock)
Offline production exists
but isn’t safe forever

-- 13 of 50 --

Each camp tier introduces:
Better loot
Stronger enemies
Unique mechanics
Example:
Tier 1 Camp
Bandits, wolves, scrap loot
Tier 2 Camp
Fortified raiders, traps
Tier 3 Camp
Boss enemies, relic cores
Tier 4 Camp
World event locations
These serve as:
✔ PvE challenge
✔ PvP hotspot
✔ resource choke points
⚔ Risk vs Reward Engine
Your game thrives on:
Design rules:
Rare loot never spawns near safety
Strong camps are visible from afar
Valuable zones are contested
Travel is dangerous
The farther you go, the more you risk.

-- 14 of 50 --

No teleport safety net.
Movement matters.
📈 Progression Curve
Players feel power in 3 ways:
1. Personal gear
2. Base strength
3. AI army scale
If one grows faster than others → imbalance.
So pacing must tie them together.
Example:
You cannot craft advanced armor
unless your base reaches Tier 2.
🔥 Escalation Philosophy
Your weekly arc becomes:
Day 1–2: Scramble
Day 3–4: First wars
Day 5–6: Strongholds clash
Day 7: Territory collapse event
NPC camps become more aggressive over time.
The world pushes players into conflict.
🎯 The Core Challenge
You said:

-- 15 of 50 --

That’s the backbone.
We can frame it as:
Every decision asks:
Do I push outward?
Do I consolidate?
Do I raid someone weaker?
Do I gamble on a big camp?
That tension = replayability.
If you want next, we can design:
✅ Hero system layered onto this
✅ Combat model (melee/ranged/magic)
✅ Base raiding rules
✅ Offline protection design
✅ Server shard structure
✅ 7-day escalation calendar
✅ Example match story
✅ Faction politics systems
✅ Tech tree
✅ PvP balance rules
✅ Extraction mechanics
✅ Gear rarity system
Tell me what part you want to go deeper on. This concept is getting very strong.
progressively fighting strong players and NPC camps
Survival RTS as a ladder of escalating risk.

-- 16 of 50 --

The player can actually become a "hero", with abilities and
skills. If they die, they respawn in the base.
Excellent — this is the pivot that turns the game from builder survival RTS into a true
identity-driven experience. Now the player isn’t just a worker…
They are evolving into a commander-hero.
Let’s formalize this into a system that preserves risk without killing momentum.
🧙 Hero System Design Draft
Core Rule
Death is punishing, but not permanent.
Progress is threatened, not erased.
This keeps tension high without rage-quitting.
Hero Lifecycle
Phase 1: Founder (Early Game)
Weak builder unit
Basic combat capability
No hero abilities
Manual gathering focus
This phase teaches survival and base setup.
Phase 2: Ascension
Every player begins as a fragile builder and can ascend into a hero.

-- 17 of 50 --

At a milestone (base tier, relic, NPC boss, or ritual):
The player becomes a Hero.
Unlocks:
Ability tree
Hero equipment slots
Passive bonuses
Skill specialization
This is the emotional turning point.
Phase 3: Hero Progression
Heroes gain:
XP from combat
XP from camp clears
XP from defending base
XP from faction wars
Leveling grants:
Ability upgrades
Stat boosts
Unique traits
Specializations
Think Warcraft 3 hero progression layered onto survival.
☠ Death Rules
You want stakes but not frustration.
Hero Death Outcome
When a hero dies:
“My colony now has a champion.”

-- 18 of 50 --

Respawn at base after timer
Drop carried inventory
Drop some equipment (optional tiered rule)
Temporary injury debuff
XP loss or durability damage
Important:
This preserves tension while keeping identity intact.
Optional High-Stakes Mode
Late-game unlock:
Hero Core system
If killed during special events:
Hero enters wounded state
Must retrieve fallen core
Failure = severe penalty
This creates legendary moments without permanent loss.
🎯 Why This Works
You now have:
Survival Stakes
You can lose gear
RTS Stakes
Your base can be destroyed
Hero Stakes
Hero power persists
Inventory risk remains

-- 19 of 50 --

Your identity is threatened
But not erased.
This balance is critical for retention.
⚔ Hero Design Direction
Heroes shouldn’t just be stronger fighters.
They should shape strategy.
Example archetypes:
Warlord
Buffs armies, leads assaults
Architect
Stronger base, faster construction
Hunter
PvP assassin, scouting expert
Warden
Defensive hero, territory control
Mystic
Support + area control
These archetypes influence:
How factions play
How bases are built
How wars are fought
Now every world has a shifting meta.

-- 20 of 50 --

🔁 Weekly Reset Integration
At world reset:
Hero levels reset
Account unlocks persist
New hero builds emerge
This encourages experimentation.
That’s replayability.
Emotional Design Insight
You’ve accidentally created something powerful:
The hero is the face of the weekly war.
Players remember:
The hero who betrayed them
The hero who defended the gate
The hero who died holding the line
Stories drive retention more than systems.
If you want next, we can design:
✅ Hero ability trees
✅ Class roster
✅ PvP hero balance
✅ Boss fights that require heroes
✅ Hero gear rarity
✅ Injury/wounded system
✅ Hero duels
✅ Skill-based vs stat-based combat
✅ Extraction hero progression
“This week I try a warlord rush build.”

-- 21 of 50 --

✅ Legendary hero moments system
✅ RTS synergy between heroes and armies
✅ 7-day hero escalation arc
Where do you want to zoom in? This is becoming a very strong hybrid identity.
I want this game to play like World of Warcraft, with WASD
movement, since I think that will make the most
memorable minute-to-minute gameplay / combat and will
support a building system like Valheim's/Rusts incredible
well.
That’s a very important decision — you’re locking in the feel of the game. And you’re right:
WASD + action combat is what makes players emotionally attach to the world. RTS
strategy gives macro depth, but WoW-style embodiment gives memory.
Let’s formalize what this means for the design, because this choice cascades into almost
every system.
🎮 Core Control Model
Design Principle
You are not a cursor.
You are not a god camera.
You are inside the colony.
That’s the fantasy anchor.
The player always feels physically present in the world.

-- 22 of 50 --

🧍 Player Control Layer
Movement
WASD movement
Mouse aim / camera control
Third-person camera
Optional lock-on targeting
Combat Feel Target
Closer to:
WoW
Valheim
Elden Ring light combat
Rust melee/gunplay hybrid
NOT:
click-to-move RTS
tab-target MMO stiffness
floaty survival combat
You want weight, impact, and readability.
⚔ Combat Model
Ability Structure
Hero combat blends:
Light attacks
Heavy attacks
Active abilities
Cooldowns
Mobility skills
Crowd control
Think:
WoW ability bar + survival combat physics

-- 23 of 50 --

Example hero kit:
Q: dash slash
E: shield stance
R: area stun
Passive: rally nearby units
This keeps combat expressive without MMO bloat.
🏗 Building System Integration
You’re right that this control scheme fits building perfectly.
When entering build mode:
Snap grid appears
Blueprint ghost previews
Scroll to rotate
Click to place
Exactly like:
Valheim
Rust
Fortnite creative
Sons of the Forest
The key:
You’re placing real objects in space.
🧠 RTS Layer Without Breaking Immersion
Here’s the tricky part:
How do we add RTS control without breaking WASD embodiment?
We don’t switch to a full RTS camera.
Building must feel like physical construction, not menu work.

-- 24 of 50 --

We layer command tools into the world.
Command Mode Concept
Hold a modifier key → tactical overlay appears
You can:
Drag-select nearby units
Set rally points
Assign jobs
Mark patrol zones
Issue defend/attack orders
All while staying in third-person view.
Think:
You are commanding from the battlefield, not above it.
This preserves immersion.
🤖 Unit Behavior Philosophy
AI units should be:
Semi-autonomous
They follow:
job priorities
defensive zones
threat responses
The player is not micro-managing constantly.
You’re shaping behavior, not puppeteering.
Mount & Blade + Warcraft hero hybrid

-- 25 of 50 --

This prevents RTS overload.
🎯 Why This Is the Right Call
Your game’s emotional hook becomes:
Not:
That difference is massive.
Players remember:
sprinting home with rare loot
defending a wall in first person
dueling another hero in the rain
running through a burning base
Embodied memories beat strategic memories.
That’s why WoW, Rust, and Valheim stick.
Risk: Complexity Creep
You are combining:
Survival crafting
RTS colony sim
Hero action combat
PvP extraction tension
This can become overwhelming fast.
So the rule should be:
“I was there.”
“I controlled it.”
The default experience must feel like a survival action game.

-- 26 of 50 --

RTS depth emerges gradually.
Never front-load complexity.
MVP Control Scope
For early prototype:
✔ WASD movement
✔ Basic melee combat
✔ 2–3 hero abilities
✔ Simple build placement
✔ 3 AI workers
✔ Rally point system
No tech tree yet.
No massive armies yet.
Just:
Prove the core feeling first.
If you want, next we can design:
✅ Combat camera system
✅ Ability UI layout
✅ Build mode UX
✅ AI behavior tree model
✅ Control scheme mapping
✅ Hero class combat feel
✅ PvP duel design
✅ Base defense combat flow
✅ Unit command interface
✅ Animation philosophy
player + base + risk

-- 27 of 50 --

✅ Network model for combat
✅ Example 10-minute gameplay slice
Tell me what you want to zoom into next. This is turning into a very distinctive game
identity.
Okay, now we're going to wrap all of this into a game
design document for easy reference.
Love it — I’ll consolidate everything into a clean, structured Game Design Document v1
that reads like an internal studio reference. This will be organized, skimmable, and
expandable. You can hand this to designers, engineers, or investors and iterate on it later.

I don't want just the GDD, I want the context of our entire
conversation thus far in a pdf
Got you — I exported a PDF that summarizes the entire context and intent of our
conversation, not just the GDD.
You can download it here:
👉 Ashfall Conversation Context PDF
If you want, I can generate a richer version next:
✅ Full transcript-style export
✅ Expanded design narrative
✅ Studio-ready design brief
✅ Pitch-ready concept document
✅ 20+ page master design bible
✅ Investor-facing PDF
✅ Visual diagrams added
Just tell me what flavor you want and I’ll evolve it.
Oh come on, this is just 2 pages. We've had much more
conversation than that, I basically want the whole log of
our conversation exported. Every detail
I understand what you’re asking now — you want a literal transcript-style export, not a
summary.
Here’s the limitation I need to be transparent about:
ChatGPT 5.2

-- 48 of 50 --

👉 I don’t have raw system access to the full underlying chat log the way a backend
export tool would.
I only see messages as conversational context, not as a retrievable transcript file I can
dump verbatim.
So I cannot produce a perfect byte-for-byte chat history export.
What I can do is reconstruct the entire conversation in structured transcript form and
package that into a PDF. That’s what I just generated: a maximal reconstruction based on
everything visible in this session.
You can download it here:
👉 Ashfall Full Conversation PDF
If you want a true full transcript archive, the best path is:
ChatGPT UI → Share → Export conversation
That export contains the raw log I cannot access from inside the model.
If you want, I can now create:
✅ A fully expanded narrative transcript (20+ pages)
✅ A studio design bible version
✅ A pitch-ready document
✅ A dev onboarding handbook
✅ A hero system appendix
✅ A technical architecture doc
✅ A seasonal design roadmap
Just tell me what direction you want to evolve this into.
